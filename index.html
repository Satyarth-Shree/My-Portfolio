	<h1 style = "text-align: center; font-family: Courier New; font-size: 300%; color: white;">About Me</h1>
	<p style = "text-align: center; font-size: 100%; color: white; font-family: Courier New;">
	I’m an incoming B.Tech student in Robotics and Automation Engineering, focused on building practical tools using Python and web technologies. I previously built a CLI-based Habit Tracker to reinforce daily discipline, but lost the original version—an experience that taught me the value of backups, documentation, and building scalable versions from the start. I’m now working on a more structured Student Dashboard web app to replace and improve that idea. <br>

I document my learning through blog posts and personal projects, applying a disciplined, principle-based approach inspired by timeless strategies—focusing on mastery through deliberate practice and self-reliance. My current focus areas include Python, HTML/CSS, Git, and systems thinking, forming the technical foundation for my future in robotics and automation.

<b>CLI-Based Habit Tracker</b><br>
Previously Built — Being Rebuilt<br>
A Python-based command-line tool designed to track daily habits and streaks.
The original version featured CSV-based data logging, calendar logic, and automated streak tracking. Though the initial build was lost, the core logic and lessons from this tool are now being integrated into a more advanced and user-friendly Student Dashboard Web App currently in development.
This transition reflects a shift from personal scripts to scalable tools with real-world usability. <br>

<p style = "font-size: 100%; color: white; font-family: Courier New;">
I write blog posts to document my learning journey, deepen my understanding of key concepts, and help other beginners navigate coding and tool-building with clarity. Blogging serves both as a method of self-reinforcement and as a way to build a public archive of my growth in programming, robotics, and systems thinking.<br>

One of my recent posts gives a detailed overview of a CLI-based Habit Tracker tool I built using Python. Although the original project was lost, I had already shared its purpose, core features, challenges, and development logic on Medium — preserving the insights I gained. <a href = "https://medium.com/@satyarthshree45/build-a-habit-tracker-cli-tool-in-python-how-i-did-it-beginner-project-3e96d1c53ea1" style = "color: yellow;">Click here to view it</a><br>

As I continue to build and explore, my blog will remain a space where I simplify technical ideas, reflect on what works, and document how I learn through action. Medium will remain as my secondary blog while Hashnode will be my main blogging platform. <br>
